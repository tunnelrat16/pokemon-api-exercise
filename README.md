## Pokemon API

Your task is to build and deploy an API to create, read, update, and delete Pokemon. The API should:

* Return a list of Pokemon in this format:

```json
{
  "results": [{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "bulbasaur"
  },{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "ivysaur"
  }]
}
```

* Return individual pokemon in this format:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "bulbasaur",
  "imageUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png"
}
```

* Create new pokemon
* Update existing pokemon
* Delete pokemon

Finally, create a README with a link to your deployed API.

## Success Criteria

* `GET` responses should conform to the provided standards
* Have routes for all CRUD-L actions
* All routes should follow RESTful conventions
* Spring Boot app should have at least one controller, service, repository, and model
* Database should be seeded with the 20 provided pokemon
* Errors should be handled
* App should be deployed to a cloud provider
* Database connection should use environment variables
